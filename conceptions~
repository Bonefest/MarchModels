We have a viewport, where our scene is displayed.
We have a sidebar, where we can choose desired primitives and place them on the scene.
We can combine primitives to create more complex structures.

We have two three modes:
  1. Spectator mode - Objects are displayed in the simplest way.
  2. Builder mode - Moving around scene is disabled.
  3. Beauty mode - Objects are displayed with all applied effects.
We can also enable spectator mode and view our scene from different points of view.
